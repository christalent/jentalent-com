## 2026-10-01

### Site polish
- **Canonical name** across all pages: now `Jenifer Talent` everywhere (was a mix of `Jen`, `Jeni`, `Jenifer`). Logos, titles, meta descriptions, footers, and intro paragraph updated on all 4 pages.
- **Canonical contact email** across all pages: now `jeniffer@jeniffer.org` (the address used in footers/contact cards). Resume header no longer shows the alt `jentalent@gmail.com` address.
- **`resume.html` — phone number removed** from resume header to match the home page policy ("Phone: Available upon request"). Refs #7.
- **`resume.html` — fixed stray `</div>` after Administrative Experience** that was causing Notary Public / Volunteer sections to render at a different left margin. Refs #8.
- **`services.html` — "Birthday affidavits" → "Birth certificate affidavits"** in Personal Documents. Refs #4.
- **`services.html` — "swear or affirms" → "swears or affirms"** in Jurat / Subscribe & Swear description.
- **`main.js` — header comment** updated to canonical name.

Closes #2, #3, #4, #7, #8.

### log.html / log.js (new)
- Extracted the broken inline `<script>` from `log.html` into a new `log.js`, loaded with `<script defer src="log.js">`. Fixes the page where Add/Edit/Save/Delete/Export all threw `ReferenceError`.
- Closed XSS hole: row rendering now uses `createElement` + `textContent` for every user-supplied field instead of interpolating into `tbody.innerHTML`.
- Removed the page-specific inline `<style>` block (selectors were scoped enough to live independently; can be folded into `style.css` later if desired).
- Date format kept as "Sep 30, 2026" to match the prior UI.
- Behavior preserved: add, edit, delete, search filter, CSV export, total / this-month counters, modal open/close + backdrop click + Escape key.
- See PR #6 / Issue #1.
